I think the simplest way to deal with something like that, would be an app. Of course there can be better devices to ensure you do not forget, but an app is universally available and simply easier to deploy. The app would have to detect when you are walking and if it is possible, try to record the motions you do when you walk properly and then record the motions you do when you walk without confidence. Once it can compare the motions using its gyroscope, it could vibrate or play an alarm whenever you changed your posture.

The GPS ability would also allow the phone to automatically adjust its settings based on location, becoming more sensitive when in a library for example.

I have tried numerous things to try and help so here is the design I believe would help the best. If you want a chair then you need 2 straps that loop near the top of the chair that the user can put their arms through and tightened once over their shoulders. It should not be extremely tight but just enough to be a reminder to pull the shoulders back. This will align the shoulders and help pull the neck back into place. Other straps would not be needed if these straps were in place. The massages in the chair should primarily be located towards the inner shoulder blades and rotate in circles  massaging the area along the shoulder blades with adjustable pressures and range. Also the massages themselves should be able to produce heat. It would feel like a warm rock massage. To finish off, the seat of the chair should be properly cushioned for comfort and to allow for hip balance and correct posture. This would help deter the need for straps and it\'s important the user use some muscles of their own for posture. Also, a lumbar that is not too thick or too thin would also help with the posture and deter the need for straps.

The body is flexible and needs to bend and move.  I would think a chair that allowed the sitter to bend out the top and the bottom at will while keeping the center of the back (adjustable for height) stationary would eventually lead to the user sitting up straight.  Also, allowing the arms of the chair to bend out so that the sitter may draw their knees up Indian style would also be good, as I find I tend to sit straighter in chairs with no arms or arms large enough to accommodate drawing up the knees (papasan etc).  Allowing the bottom of the chair to flex as well would allow for different body shapes and heights.  The problem I have with most chairs is that if I sit up \'perfectly straight\' in them my tailbone tends to press against the back bottom of the chair and my shoulders just barely touch the back of the seat - which leads to my slouching down to achieve more contact with the chair.  I am tall which does not allow my arms to rest comfortably on most armrests.. they are several inches below my elbows.  A chair that could adjust the back up to meet and support a short or tall person\'s back while allowing their hips and pelvis to push the bottom out of the chair out to a natural position would keep most people sitting straighter to do tasks.  Adjustable or flexible armrest height would also help.\"},{\"image\":\"h6j3PIJ\",\"text\":\"Two straps that are thick and of the same size & length as seat belts.

And instead of a belt , have extra side bars to keep the person in the chair.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nSo using extra side bars to combine both ideas.\\r\\r\\nthat is what is in this drawing. the drawing is a bit unclear due to camera quality. But the main point is sidebars extra.\\r\"},{\"image\":\"wfGGygL\",\"text\":\" idea is interesting and needed. I will suggest a design that I believe will help me. 90% of the people I know have bad posture due to sitting long periods of time at a computer which usually affects the shoulders first bowing over and then the neck starts to lean forward losing its \\\"c\\\" curve. I have tried numerous things to try and help so here is the design I believe would help the best. If you want a chair then you need 2 straps that loop near the top of the chair that the user can put their arms through and tightened once over their shoulders. It should not be extremely tight but just enough to be a reminder to pull the shoulders back. This will align the shoulders and help pull the neck back into place. Other straps would not be needed if these straps were in place. The massages in the chair should primarily be located towards the inner shoulder blades and rotate in circles  massaging the area along the shoulder blades with adjustable pressures and range. Also the massages themselves should be able to produce heat. It would feel like a warm rock massage. To finish off, the seat of the chair should be properly cushioned for comfort and to allow for hip balance and correct posture. This would help deter the need for straps and it\'s important the user use some muscles of their own for posture. Also, a lumbar that is not too thick or too thin would also help with the posture and deter the need for straps. I describe what I would like to have for myself since I sit at a computer all day.\"},{\"image\":\"ww9Foqp\"},{\"image\":\"xJt7dKj\",\"text\":\"The seat has sensors that adjust the length of the straps in such a way that it always makes the person to sit in the correct posture.

A comfy foot rest is also attached to the table, which provides special technology for keeping the legs level at an angle to prevent cramping.  Included is also a chair, which enables the user to choose between three angles at sitting, taking pressure off the back as it massages. \\r\"},{\"image\":\"c80ab4d3cd12c6f0f114998ff4c85571_original\",\"text\":\"Take a lumbar support, add middle and upper back support.
